## Getting started

### One-click deploy (recommended)

If you'd like to host your resume for free on Netlify, the button below will
clone this repo to your GitHub profile and deploy it automatically.

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/seanWLawrence/resume">
  <img alt="Deploy to netlify" src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" width="165"/>
</a>

Then you can clone the repo locally and make your changes. Voila!

### Manual setup 

Clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/seanWLawrence/resume
```

Then you can [deploy anywhere you can deploy create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment).

## Customization

The project structure is:

```
public/ # you'll want to edit the files in this folder with your own name
  index.html # HTML template React gets injected into

  logo512.png
src/
  assets/ # images
